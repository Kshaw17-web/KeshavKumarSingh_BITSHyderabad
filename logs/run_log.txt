Datathon Scaffold Automation - Run Log
====================================
Timestamp: 2025-11-28 15:05:42

1. Workspace directories ensured under C:\datathon_work (data/raw, src/extractor, src/utils, results, screenshots, logs).
2. Extracted datathon_upload_bundle.zip into data/raw and TRAINING_SAMPLES.zip (when present) into data/raw/training_samples.
3. Saved recursive file inventory to logs/file_list.txt for auditing.
4. Generated starter files: requirements.txt, README.md, ORIGIN_STATEMENT.md, .gitignore, FastAPI scaffold plus extractor/utils helpers, run_tests.bat.
5. Initialized git repo, created dev branch, committed scaffold, and tagged scaffold-ready.
6. Ran run_tests.bat (requests failed pending API start/dep setup); outputs captured in results/smoke_test_outputs.txt and screenshot saved.
7. Rendered folder tree and smoke test screenshots into screenshots/ folder.
8. Packaged entire workspace into results/datathon_artifacts.zip (created outside results then moved in).
9. Attempted to open GitHub new repo/settings pages (login required) and BFHL portal (domain unresolved). Clipboard primed with suggested repo name.

Next steps for Keshav:
- Activate a virtualenv, install requirements, and customize extractor logic.
- Update ORIGIN_STATEMENT.md before pushing and rerun run_tests after uvicorn is reachable.
- Upload datathon_artifacts.zip or push to private repo once manual edits complete.
